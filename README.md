# bbb-kaldi-connector

This repository is the result of my master programm project at the [LT Group](https://github.com/uhh-lt) at the Univeristy of Hamburg.
The main goal of this project was to integrate a speech recognition pipeline into the [BigBlueButton Conference System](https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton).
It further allows to display recognized speech as closed captions in BBB's HTML5 client.

## Usage 

```
go run audio_relay.go bbb_secret_path_token sentry_url
```
